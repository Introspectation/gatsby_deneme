Gatsby Quick Start Guide

Install Node.js (Skipping detailed steps, assuming pre-installed).

Install Gatsby CLI Globally:

Open Command Prompt.
Run: npm install -g gatsby-cli
This installs the Gatsby Command Line Interface globally, allowing you to create new Gatsby sites from anywhere on your system.
Create a New Gatsby Site:

Navigate to the directory where you want your new site to be.
Run: gatsby new [SITE_NAME]
This command creates a new Gatsby project with all necessary configurations.
Start Developing:

Change directory: cd [SITE_NAME]
Open your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) with: code .
Trust the author if prompted, to enable all features.
Use the internal terminal in VSCode:
Run: gatsby develop
This starts the development server. Wait until the build completes and visit http://localhost:8000 to see your site.
Explore GraphQL data using GraphiQL at http://localhost:8000/___graphql:
Run this query to see file IDs:
{
  allFile {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
This query fetches the IDs of all files included in your Gatsby site, illustrating how data is structured.
Partial Deployment with Netlify:

Note: Full deployment details skipped for brevity.
Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to the repository.
This method leverages continuous deployment, significantly simplifying the update process.

The fastest way to combine your favorite tools and APIs to build the fastest sites, stores, and apps for the web. And also the best place to build, deploy, and host your Gatsby sites.

NOT THIS IS HOMEWORK NOT A REAL PROJECT
